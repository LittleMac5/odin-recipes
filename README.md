# odin-recipes

Building a basic recipe website that will consist of a main index page, while linking to a few recipes. 

A couple skills that I hope to demonstrate is the ability to link pages together and allow the user to freely move throughout the site. Also I look to demonstrate basic knowledge on how to import images, text and other useful visuals onto the website.
