    <h2>Pan Seared Tilapia fillets are topped with a fresh, bright, and simple peach and cucumber salsa. Delicious 30 minute meal!</h2>

    <p>I’m so jealous of my neighbor’s peach tree! Although I suppose I don’t really need to be…since she’s constantly passing me bags of fruit over the fence. But, she totally benefits from it. The last batch resulted in several jars of Peach Freezer Jam, which I happily handed back to her. What I had left, went into this summer salsa. It’s so simple, bright, and delicious. I spotted it in Food Network magazine and had to make it immediately. Any mild white fish would work here, although cooking times will vary. Her tree is almost bare now, so I guess it’s back to the store-bought variety. *cries* I am so spoiled.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium ripe yellow peaches , diced</li>
        <li>1 small cucumber , peeled, seeded, and diced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion</li>
        <li>1 small jalapeño , seeded, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro or parsley</li>
        <li>1/3 cup finely chopped fresh cilantro or parsley</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 6 ounce skinless Tilapia fillets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, gently combine the peaches, cucumber, red onion, jalapeño, cilantro, and lime juice. Season with some salt and a few grinds of black pepper, to taste. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Warm olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. When oil is hot, season the Tilapia with salt and pepper on both sides and add to the skillet; sear fillets until golden on the outside and flake with a fork, about 3 minutes per side, depending on the thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer fillets to individual serving plates and top with some of the salsa. Serve extra salsa on the side.</li>
    </ol>
