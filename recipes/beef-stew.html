    <h2>Hearty slow cooker beef stew, loaded with vegetables, super tender meat, and packed with incredible flavor.</h2>

    <p>I took my unbelievable classic beef stew recipe (seriously the best beef stew ever – MAKE IT!), tweaked several ingredients and converted it to the crock pot and this slow cooker beef stew was born. It’s so delicious! That’s saying a lot, since I’m not a huge crock pot lover. But this recipe is great – the vegetables are tender, but not mushy and the flavor is totally there. Not bland at all, like so many slow cooker recipes tend to be. Whomp whomp.</p>
